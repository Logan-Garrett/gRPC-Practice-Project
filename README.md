# gRPC-Practice-Project
gRPC-Practice-Project


* This project has a gRPC Service and a REST Web API. It runs gRPC and REST in parallel and a client pulls from them 10k times and gets the speed. This was more or less a introduction for me into gRPC/protobuffs to see how it worked and what was the fastest way to use it. In this same project a new service for protobuf and lmdb will be created to see how it works and to fool around with different ideas. Providing experience and a place to fool around with new ideas related. Most likely the project will have the name changed.
